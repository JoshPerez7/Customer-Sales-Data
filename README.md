## Instructions

Write SQL queries for each of the following questions. Assuming that all tables follow typical database conventions.

1. Write a query to return the customer_name, product_name, and total_amount for each sale in the last 30 days.
2. Write a query to find the total revenue generated by each product category in the last year. The output should include the product category and the total revenue for that category.
3. Write a query to return all customers who made purchases in 2023 and are located in the "West" region.
4. Write a query to display the total number of sales, total quantity sold, and total revenue for each customer. The result should include the customer_name, total sales, total quantity, and total revenue.
5. Write a query to find the top 3 customers (by total revenue) in the year 2023.
6. Write a query to rank products by their total sales quantity in 2023. The result should include the product_name, total quantity sold, and rank.
7. Write a query that categorizes customers into "New" (if they signed up in the last 6 months) or "Existing" based on their sign_up_date. Include the customer_name, region, and category in the result.
8. Write a query to return the month and year along with the total sales for each month for the last 12 months.
9. Write a query to return the product categories that generated more than $50,000 in revenue during the last 6 months.
10. Write a query to check for any sales where the total_amount doesnâ€™t match the expected value (i.e., quantity * price).
